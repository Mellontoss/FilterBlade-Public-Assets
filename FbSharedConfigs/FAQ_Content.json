This is done in order to keep the filter up-to-date with the live economy and meta state. If suddenly something becomes more expensive/cheaper (due to a build becoming popular, game changes or a new tech being discovered), you will know. However, you CAN control this behaviour: <br>a) Any item you have moved within the tierlist will stick to that tier. Your changes have priority over economy updates<br>b) Any item you have NOT moved may be adjusted by the economy, unless you 'LOCK' them. You can lock individual items or the whole tierlist by using the 'advanced toolbar' in economy-based sections.<br>c) You can use the stable filter.

If filters would be a POE skilltree, modules would be jewels. A filter can include 0 to 15 modules and a single module can affect multiple filters. Modules are great if you want to have the same set of changes across multiple filters. For instance if you want to reuse the same style or tiering you can save these in a module and then apply them onto one or multiple filters. Every time you load a save, it fetches the latest version of the module. You can also browse for public and 'official' modules on the overview screen!",

      "answer": "To save a module go to my modules and click 'save' there. To turn a filter into a module load the filter and save it under 'my modules'. However, you can't save a filter that uses a module into another module.",
      "tags": "module turn convert save"
    },
    {
      "question": "My module is behaving weirdly, why is that?",
      "answer": "Like normal filter-saveStates, modules work not by saving the current, final state of the filter, but by saving the changes you made. Meaning if something is back on its initial value, it doesn't count as change and is therefore not applied in the filter. This can happen a lot in ever-changing parts like tierlists, where items move often and rules get disabled all the time.<br>Another tricky part are strictnesses. The strictness you used when creating a module doesn't directly matter, but it allows you to do changes that aren't possible otherwise. For example you can't have a module that disables Chancing Bases when you work on a low stirctness, because that section is already disabled, meaning it wouldn't be a change and therefore not saved. Changing to a high strictness allows you to do and save this change.<br><br><br>Another reason for odd behaviors is the fact that your filter might already have changes in the section that the module edits and overwrites it. You can try Shift-Rightclicking a section to hard-reset it, which doesn't set the section back to its initial values, but instead deletes all of your local changes, causing the module to take effect again. This can sometimes make a difference.",

      "question": "What's the benefit of the auto-update feature? Does it help if I'm using SSF? Is it pay to win? Is it legal?",
      "answer": "The auto-update is a pure quality of life feature. You get my latest filter ingame, based on the latest economy data and merged with all your style, custom sound, customization and module choices. Our servers export that filter directly onto your POE account. You can also get the same result, by visiting the filterblade website every few days. Essentially it saves you a couple of minutes. It's also useful in SSF. Expensive items are often the very same that are desirable on SSF and you still want the filter patches. The feature has been allowed by GGG (we talked to Bex about it). The feature causes too high server costs to be free and is one of the two ways how we sponsor our server and development costs.

      "answer": "The auto-update loads all changes you've done on FilterBlade every 4-to-6 hours and merges them into the latest version of my filter you've selected. My economy-based versions are updated every 6 hours and the tiering is adjusted based on the current SC/HC economy data (mostly poe.ninja data). This ensures that you get the up-to-date tiering (with currency, uniques, scarabs divination cards and ~20 others tierlists all getting updated) combined with all your customizer, style, module/module and all other changes.

Always update your filter before a new challenge league starts (every 3 month). FilterBlade is always updated with the latest NeverSink's filter on launch-day before the new league starts. Missing out on the league-start update can cause you to miss items or the filter to not work. Afterwards, we recommend weekly filter updates, as long as you play actively, to receive the latest meta- and economy-updates.<br><br>The filters you get by following NeverSink on the PoE filter ladder are updated automatically.

      "answer": "The softcore/hardcore filters are updated every 4 hours. These updates adjust the tiering of all tierlists, such as uniques, currency, cards, cluster jewels etc. There's a total of 20+ different tierlists. This way the filer can provide you the best possible ingame experience. The stable filter is only updated, when the filter is updated manually. These always happen the day before the league starts and quite often during the first month of a new league. Note that you need to load your save and download/sync again to receive these changes in-game, no matter what version you use.",

Distributed using AWS CloudFront CDN together with CloudFlare (where we also have our domain).<br>- The backend is an array of serverless AWS Lambda Functions with API-Gateway, written in C#/.NET, which have proven to scale excellently with the varying demand over the course of a league.<br>- As database, we are using a NoSQL DynamoDB to store all the 'meta'-data about saveStates, while the actual content of them is stored as files in a separate S3 Storage to reduce database size.<br>- We use DevOps pipelines to build and deploy front & backend while Trello is used for workItem-tracking.<br>- The programming languages are vanilla JavaScript/CSS/HTML for frontend (yes, we're maniacs) and C#/.NET for the backend.<br>- The frontend heavily employs our own domain languages to generate the customizer, overview and loot simulator screens<br>- The filter generation has a similar setup (AWS Lambda, C#/.NET) and generates the filters and all of it's styles from a domain language (.exo).",

      "question": "What's the difference between filter Download and Sync? What's recommended?",

You need to login for the first (this is a safe login, search for OAUTH here for details, we don't get any of your credentials). Download gives you the filter file directly. You will then need to place the file into the \"%userprofile%/Documents/My Games/Path of Exile\" (or Path of Exile 2) repository for it to work. Both have their up and downsides. Sync is generally speaking more comfortable, but it 'caches' the filter if multiple syncs are done in quick succession and it might take up to 10 min to arrive ingame. New syncs seem to always arrive instantly. It also doesn't work when the POE servers are down/updating. Download on the other hand takes a few extra clicks and spams your download folder, but is very reliable.",
